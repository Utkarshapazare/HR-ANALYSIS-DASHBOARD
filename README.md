# HR-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD
# 💼 HR Analytics Dashboard Project

Welcome to my **HR Analytics Dashboard** project! This repository showcases interactive and visually appealing dashboards built using **Tableau** and **Power BI** to analyze and visualize key HR metrics and trends.

The dashboards are designed to help HR teams make data-driven decisions by providing insights into employee attrition, department performance, work-life balance, job satisfaction, promotions, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 🧠 Goal:
To explore an HR dataset and extract actionable insights through compelling dashboards that answer critical business questions such as:
- Why are employees leaving the organization?
- Which departments or roles have the highest attrition rates?
- How do work-life balance and job satisfaction affect retention?
- Which job roles are most affected by poor promotion cycles?

This project demonstrates how HR data can be transformed into strategic assets using modern BI tools.
